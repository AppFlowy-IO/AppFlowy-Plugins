## Melos

To make it easier to manage a federated package approach, we use [Melos](https://pub.dev/packages/melos). If you need to develop across multiple packages, you can bootstrap melos by running `melos bootstrap`.

Scripts available:
`melos run analyze`: Run `dar analyze .` in all packages.
`melos run format`: Run `dart format --set-exit-if-changed` in all packages.
`melos run get`: Run `flutter pub get` in all packages.
